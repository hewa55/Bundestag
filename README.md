# Bundestag
This repository is for a project to analyse language of German Bundestag sessions. It uses Textblob-de to understand the sentiment of the different parties during the debate.
The output is an aggregated view of how positive, neutral and negative the party was at that particular day.
It only offers a snapshot of the debate and highly depends on the topics debated.
